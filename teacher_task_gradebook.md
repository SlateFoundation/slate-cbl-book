# Teacher Task Management
###Create a Task
- Teachers can create a task and assign it to any number of students in the section
- In the Title bar, previous tasks are searchable by name and show the date created as well as the creator
- Optionally, creators of tasks can add them to the task database for future use by others, thus simplifying the task creation process

###Evaluate a Task
- Teachers can evaluate a task at any time (even if not yet submitted by students)
- The interface indicates when a student has submitted or resubmitted a task and whether it is one time or late

###Status of a Task

  - Not Assigned
  - Due
  - Needs Rated
  - Completed
  - Revision Assigned
