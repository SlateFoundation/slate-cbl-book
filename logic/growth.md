## Baseline Rating

Baseline ratings are stored on the `StudentCompetency` model, and can come to be set three ways:

- In bulk via the enrollment tool
- From the average of the previous level during auto-graduation
- If no baseline is otherwise set by the time at least one rating is available for every skill, the average of the earliest rating in each skill is saved as the baseline
