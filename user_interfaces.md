Demonstrations that show in the grid
The top X scores show for each standard where X is the number of evidence requirements for that standard
If multiple equivalent scores exceed the number of demonstrations required, the most recent score should be shown
If X scores have not been logged, Missed Demonstrations appear at the end
Lower scores and Ms are replaced when higher scores are logged

Completion progress of each competency
Shown with both a numerical percentage in the center of the competency row and graphically with the cell filling from left to right in the background
Calculated as total demonstrations logged divided by total demonstrations required for all the standards within that competency

Average score in a competency
Shown by default as a hover state in each competency row
Calculated as the average of the top X logged demonstrations for each standard where X is the number of evidence requirements for each standard 
Once a competency is 50% complete, if the average score is below the minimum passing threshold, the average score remains fixed in the cell with a red notation behind it
